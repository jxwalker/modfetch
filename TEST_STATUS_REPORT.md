## Current Status

This report is historical. The gaps listed below were later closed: scanner,
library, settings, integration, and benchmark tests now exist. On 2026-04-26,
`go test ./... -timeout 180s` and `go test ./... -race -timeout 240s` passed on
the local development machine.

---

## Testing Environment Status

### ✅ What We CAN Test (Sandboxed Environment)
- Code syntax and formatting
- Static analysis
- Code review and inspection
- Manual code walkthroughs

### ❌ What We CANNOT Test (Network Required)
- Running Go tests (requires SQLite dependency download)
- Integration tests
- Build verification (requires dependency download)

## Historical Issues Identified

### ✅ CLOSED: Performance Issue in Scanner
**File:** internal/scanner/scanner.go, lines 122-142
**Function:** `findExistingMetadata()`

**Issue:**
```go
// INEFFICIENT: Loads ALL metadata into memory then filters in Go
results, err := s.db.ListMetadata(filters)
for _, meta := range results {
    if meta.Dest == path {
        return &meta, nil
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- O(n) scan for every file
- 1000 files in library = 1,000,000 operations
- Memory: Loads all metadata on every lookup

**Solution:** Add database index + direct query (see next section)

---

## Manual Testing Completed

### ✅ Code Review Status

#### Scanner Package
- ✅ Code structure reviewed
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ Proper error handling patterns
- ✅ Uses exported ExtractQuantization() from metadata package
- ✅ Returns detailed ScanResult with counts
- ⚠️ Performance issue identified (findExistingMetadata)

#### Library View
- ✅ Code structure reviewed
- ✅ Rendering functions properly structured
- ✅ Keyboard navigation handlers implemented
- ✅ Search functionality integrated
- ✅ Detail view with comprehensive metadata display
- ✅ No obvious syntax errors

#### Settings Tab
- ✅ Code structure reviewed
- ✅ Read-only configuration display
- ✅ Token status with visual indicators (✓/✗)
- ✅ All configuration sections covered
- ✅ No obvious syntax errors

---

## Testing Blockers

### Environment Limitations
1. **No Network Access:** Cannot download Go dependencies (SQLite)
2. **No Test Execution:** Cannot run `go test` commands
3. **No Build Verification:** Cannot compile binaries

### Workarounds Applied
1. ✅ Code inspection and review
2. ✅ Syntax validation with gofmt
3. ✅ Static analysis of code structure
4. ✅ Manual walkthrough of logic paths

---

## Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Add Database Index ⏭️ NEXT
**File:** internal/state/metadata.go
**Action:** Add index on `dest` column for fast lookup
**Impact:** 10-100x speedup for scanner
**Effort:** 0.5 days

### 2. Optimize Scanner Query
**File:** internal/scanner/scanner.go
**Action:** Replace ListMetadata loop with direct query
**Depends On:** Step 1 (database index)
**Effort:** 0.5 days

### 3. Create Scanner Tests
**File:** internal/scanner/scanner_test.go (NEW)
**Tests:** 10+ test cases covering all scanner functionality
**Effort:** 2-3 days

### 4. Create Library View Tests
**File:** internal/tui/library_test.go (NEW)
**Tests:** 10+ test cases for library UI
**Effort:** 2-3 days

### 5. Create Settings Tests
**File:** internal/tui/settings_test.go (NEW)
**Tests:** 5-7 test cases for settings UI
**Effort:** 1 day

### 6. Sprint 1 - Code Refactoring
**Action:** Split model.go into 8-10 smaller files
**Effort:** 4-5 days

---

## Test Execution Status

```
❌ BLOCKED - Cannot run tests in sandboxed environment
✅ READY - Tests will be runnable once in environment with network access
```

### When Tests CAN Be Run (Outside Sandbox)

```bash
# Run all tests
go test -v ./...

# Run specific new tests
go test -v ./internal/scanner/...
go test -v -run TestLibrary ./internal/tui/...
go test -v -run TestSettings ./internal/tui/...

# With coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

---

## Summary

### ✅ Strengths
- Existing test infrastructure is solid (1,297+ lines of tests)
- Good coverage for core features (85-95%)
- Well-structured test patterns with mocks and fixtures
- Comprehensive TESTING.md documentation

### ⚠️ Gaps
- No tests for Scanner package (302 lines untested)
- No tests for Library view (~400 lines untested)
- No tests for Settings tab (~160 lines untested)
- Performance issue in scanner needs fix before adding tests

### 🎯 Recommendation
**Proceed with plan:**
1. ✅ Testing review completed (this report)
2. ⏭️ Add database index (next)
3. ⏭️ Optimize scanner query
4. ⏭️ Begin Sprint 1

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Database optimization: 1 day
- Scanner tests: 2-3 days
- Library tests: 2-3 days
- Settings tests: 1 day
- Code refactoring: 4-5 days
- **Total: ~11-14 days for Sprint 1**

---

## Conclusion

While we cannot execute tests in the current sandboxed environment, code review indicates:
- ✅ New features are structurally sound
- ✅ No obvious bugs or syntax errors
- ⚠️ One performance issue identified (will fix next)
- ❌ Test coverage gaps exist (will address in Sprint 1)

**Status:** READY TO PROCEED with database index optimization and Sprint 1.
