# Troubleshooting

Common errors and remedies

- ComfyUI: Error while deserializing header: incomplete metadata, file not fully covered
  - Meaning: the on-disk file size does not exactly match what the safetensors header declares (or the header/offsets are invalid).
  - Fix:
    1) Scan the directory and deep-verify all safetensors files:
       
       modfetch verify --config ~/.config/modfetch/config.yml --scan-dir /path/to/checkpoints --safetensors-deep
       
       - To focus only on problem files and get a quick count:
         
         modfetch verify --config ~/.config/modfetch/config.yml --scan-dir /path/to/checkpoints --safetensors-deep --only-errors --summary
       
    2) If you see "extra bytes", repair is safe and lossless (truncate to declared size):
       
       modfetch verify --config ~/.config/modfetch/config.yml --scan-dir /path/to/checkpoints --safetensors-deep --repair
       
    3) If you see "incomplete", quarantine and re-download (data is missing):
       
       modfetch verify --config ~/.config/modfetch/config.yml --scan-dir /path/to/checkpoints --safetensors-deep --quarantine-incomplete
       
    4) Restart ComfyUI to ensure it loads the corrected file.
  - Prevention: enable in your config
    
    validation:
      safetensors_deep_verify_after_download: true
    
    This fails new downloads that donâ€™t pass deep verification. Trailing extra bytes are already auto-trimmed on download finalize.

- No space left on device
  - Message: "write failed: no space left on device"
  - Action: free disk space on the download filesystem; modfetch writes to general.download_root and uses a .part file before renaming.

- Server ignored Range; restarting from beginning
  - Message: "server ignored Range; restarting from beginning"
  - Action: the server does not support Range for resuming; modfetch restarts the single-stream download from zero.

- HEAD status not OK; falling back to single
  - Message: "chunked: falling back to single: ..."
  - Action: Some hosts block HEAD or do not advertise Accept-Ranges. modfetch falls back to single-stream automatically.

- Checksum mismatch
  - Single: "sha256 mismatch: expected=... actual=..."
  - Chunked: "sha256 mismatch after repair: expected=... got=..."
  - Action: verify the expected SHA256; if provided by upstream, re-run. For chunked downloads, modfetch re-hashes chunks and re-fetches corrupted ranges automatically before failing.

- Permission denied creating directories
  - Message: errors when creating directories under general.download_root or placement targets
  - Action: ensure the user has write permissions to the configured paths. For placement, you may need to adjust your apps base directories or run with proper permissions.

- Missing tokens
  - Message: 401/403 from huggingface.co or civitai.com
  - Action: export HF_TOKEN or CIVITAI_TOKEN in your shell if accessing gated resources. Do not store secrets in YAML.

Diagnostic tips
- Increase verbosity: use --log-level debug
- Use --json to get structured logs for programmatic analysis
- Use --summary-json to emit a single JSON summary per completed download
- TUI: press h or ? for help; s to sort by speed, e to sort by ETA
