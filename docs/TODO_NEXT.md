# Next TODO (Improvements)

Priority 1
- Configurable naming patterns for resolvers
  - Add `sources.civitai.naming.pattern` and `sources.huggingface.naming.pattern` with tokens: `{model_name}`, `{version_name}`, `{version_id}`, `{file_name}`, `{repo}`, `{path}`. CLI override `--naming-pattern`.
- Preflight auth and early 401 detection
  - Pre-download HEAD or 0â€“0 probe with Authorization; if 401 and token missing, fail early with guidance. `--no-auth-preflight` to disable.
- TUI enhancements
  - Sort by speed/ETA/remaining, actions (retry/cancel/details), warnings for missing token env, show SuggestedFilename/hostcaps, improve colors.

Priority 2
- Placement and classifier improvements
  - Better SD/LLM heuristics, presets for ComfyUI/A1111, `place --write-paths` to generate extra_model_paths.yaml, diff in dry-run.
- Batch runner improvements
  - Per-job naming/placement overrides, global concurrency, batch summary JSON, retry policies, stop-on-failure.
- Partials management polish
  - `clean --parts-only`, `--older-than`, show reclaimed space, startup warnings when stale .part present; docs for partials_root.
- Metrics expansion
  - Counters for 401s, retries by host; gauges for active downloads, per-host throughput; include build version.
- Logging and UX improvements
  - Wider `--quiet`, consistent JSON fields, rigorous secret redaction, resolver debug toggles, global throttle of repeated warnings.

Priority 3
- Safetensors verification outputs
  - `--json-out FILE` / `--csv-out FILE` for scan results; repaired/quarantined flags; non-zero exit on critical unless `--allow-partial`.
- CI and release automation
  - GitHub Actions: tests on Linux/macOS; build and attach artifacts on tag; publish SHA256SUMS. Consider goreleaser later.
- Packaging: Homebrew formula
  - Finalize formula/tap; validate arm64/amd64; completions installation.
- Docs
  - Examples for naming patterns and tokens; token setup; extra_model_paths.yaml recipes; 401/gated FAQ; v0.2.0 upgrade notes.
- Test coverage expansion
  - Auth preflight and warnings, naming token expansion, UniquePath edge cases, prealloc/progress interaction, placement dry-run.

Exploratory
- Extensible sources (design doc)
  - Plan plugin-like resolvers for `s3://`, `gcs://`, `local://`; define minimal API and safety considerations.
- Security hardening audit
  - Review logs and error paths for token leakage; add central `redact()` helper used by logging; ensure headers are never logged.

CodeRabbit follow-ups (2025-08-30)

Priority 1
- TUI ephemerals keyed by URL|Dest and exact clearing
  - Key resolving/preflight ephemerals by composite key url|dest to avoid collisions; clear only on matching DB row by URL or cleaned Dest; render resolving spinner based on the composite key.
  - Add helper ephemeralKey(url, dest) and update all call sites (addEphemeral, View spinner check, refresh clearing, dlDone handling).
  - Ensure dlDoneMsg includes both url and dest so ephemerals can be cleared precisely. [PR #8]
- Consistent dest use when starting downloads from TUI
  - When dest is blank, compute dg := destGuess(url, dest) once and use dg for preflight, addEphemeral, and startDownloadCmd so pause/cancel lookup keys match the eventual DB row. [PR #8]
- Single-stream downloader: treat HTTP 416 as already complete
  - If resuming and the server returns 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable and local .part size >= reported size, finalize (fsync, rename/copy to final, adjust safetensors), recompute SHA, upsert DB row status=complete, and return success instead of error. [PR #8]
- Sanitize destGuess and enforce containment
  - Prevent path traversal and ensure computed default filenames stay under download_root. Reject unsafe basenames ("/", ".", ".."), clean and validate with filepath.Rel; fall back to a safe default when needed. [PR #8]

Priority 2
- TUI open/reveal: use Run() and surface errors
  - Switch from exec.Command(...).Start() to .Run() so non-zero exit codes are caught; optionally wrap in an async command to avoid blocking UI; provide user-visible error on failure. [PR #8]
- Metrics manager: guard writes when disabled
  - Skip creating/writing Prometheus textfile metrics when enabled=false or path is empty to avoid os.CreateTemp failures; audit all write sites for guards. [PR #8]
- Docstrings and tests
  - Add docstrings for new TUI helpers (preflightForDownload, destGuess, addEphemeral, openInFileManager) and downloader changes.
  - Unit tests: speed/ETA sampling behavior, ephemeral clearing logic, destGuess sanitation, and single-stream 416 finalize path.
